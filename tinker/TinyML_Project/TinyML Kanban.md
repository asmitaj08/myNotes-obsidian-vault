## #backlogs



## #to-do

- [ ] Send it to Ruijie and analyze it's portability w.r.t generic API creation
- [ ] Implement example of Google's TF Lite with nrf52840 board
- [ ] Analyze the portability of APIs for edge impulse and TFLite
- [ ] Communicate with Ruijie to integrate the APIs with the existing FW on we-be band
- [ ] See how the TinyML APIs after being included in binary can be compiled into new binary, automate it using python script with nrf command
- [ ] Add feature to fetch info like config file, model name, model lib download from server to MCU
- [ ] Add feature to integrate info from config file info fw and then process the TinyML request accordingly
- [ ] Add the feature to send the result of TinyML model outcome to server for analysis (needed when user download a newly compiled binary on we-band, and then run their test, if not on server , some way for them to get this info for analysis)


## #in-progress

- [ ] Check sensiML and how it can be leveraged üî∫
- [ ] Implement one example of edge impulse on nrf840 board ‚è´
