## #backlogs



## #to-do

- [ ] Test how HPC can be leveraged
- [ ] Brainstorm about paper topic and result to be presented
- [ ] Prepare  & submit abstract for DAC 📅 2024-11-10
- [ ] Write paper for DAC
- [ ] Review and submit the paper 📅 2024-11-18
- [ ] Train the model with existing SVDs
- [ ] Generate SVDs and compare with SVD parsers


## #in-progress

- [ ] Create SVD file dataset ⏫
- [ ] Test for more use case like firmware understanding, code generation with and without datasheet upload, check the response accuracy


## #completed

**Complete**
- [x] Brainstorm about building some specific application by training the existing model ✅ 2024-10-20
- [x] Test  datasheet via notebook LLM, generate some questions and record the response, see if it can also generate specific file format ✅ 2024-10-20
- [x] Fix Grisha's llm issue, and test & compare with that ✅ 2024-10-17
